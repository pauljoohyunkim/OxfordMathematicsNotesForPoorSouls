\title{Linear Algebra I \& II Summary}
\author{Paul Kim}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section*{Preface}
Note that this is not your actual lecture note,
and I do not condone only sticking to this as your resource.
On the other hand, if you are reading this for your intuition,
you are at the right place.

This document is based on 2019 linear algebra I and 2018 linear algebra II lecture notes by Vicky Neale and Ulrike Tillmann.
You can check them out at \url{https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/} in the Archive tab.
